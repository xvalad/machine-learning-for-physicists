    "Using the above image generator (which produces random circles), and the above image size 27x27, try to set up an autoencoder network that 'works best'. The rules of the game are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You may create any kind of network, but the narrowest layer (the bottleneck) must only contain no more than 3 neurons (this defines the 'HARD' version of the challenge). Alternatively, it must only contain no more than 9 neurons (the 'MEDIUM' version of the challenge). When counting neurons, use the routine print_layers (see above!) after running a bit of the training.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You may also use any kind of optimizer, any settings for the learning rate, and any choice of batch size. No pre-processing/post-processing of the input/output of the network is allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The performance will be judged in the following way: when you start fresh training (after freshly initializing the network), what is the cost value after the network has been trained on 30000 images? (e.g. batchsize=30 and steps=1000). Look at the cost value that is printed after the training run is completed. This must be reproducible, i.e. in case of doubt or if there are several contestants with close cost values, the networks will be trained multiple times, to obtain more precise average cost values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is also the LONG-TRAINING version of the challenge: what is the cost value you can reach after training over 100,000 images?\n",
    "\n",
    "To be competitive for the MEDIUM challenge, your final cost should be below 0.02.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please post your intermediate achieved cost functions on the forum, so others can get inspired to fine-tune their network structure!\n"
